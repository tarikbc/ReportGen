# Report Generator

This script provides an automated way to summarize changes made to files in a Git repository. It uses the OpenAI API to generate concise, human-readable summaries of the `git diff` output, useful for generating changelogs or quick summaries of recent modifications.

## Features

- **Summarize Current Changes:** By default, it fetches and summarizes the `git diff` output for each changed file in your current working directory.
- **Summarize Specific Commits:** You can now specify a commit hash to summarize the changes introduced by that particular commit.
- **Batch Processing:** Sends the diff summary to OpenAI's API in batches (limited to 4000 characters) for summary generation.
- **Content Sanitization:** Sanitizes the content to ensure only relevant alphanumeric and selected symbols are included.
- **Readable Output:** Displays each summary generated by the OpenAI API, making it easy to track modifications.

## Prerequisites

- **Git**: Ensure `git` is installed and you are working in a repository.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required to send requests to OpenAIâ€™s API. This should be stored in a `.env` file in the project directory.
- **jq**: This JSON processor is used to format API request and response data.
- **cURL**: Used to make HTTP requests to the OpenAI API.
- **Python 3**: Used to parse JSON responses from the OpenAI API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
3. Ensure the required tools are installed:

   - Install `jq` on Debian-based systems with `sudo apt-get install jq`.
   - Install `curl` if not already available.
   - Ensure Python 3 is installed and accessible via `python3`.

4. Run the `install.sh` script to set up the `reportgen` command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

   This creates a symbolic link to the `index.sh` script in `/usr/local/bin`, allowing you to run `reportgen` from anywhere.

## Usage

1. **Summarize Current Working Changes:**

   ```bash
   reportgen
   ```

   This will:

   - Load your OpenAI API key from the `.env` file.
   - Check for changed files in the repository.
   - Generate a sanitized diff summary for each file, sending it in 4000-character batches to OpenAI for summarization.
   - Display the output of each summarized topic in the terminal.

2. **Summarize a Specific Commit:**

   ```bash
   reportgen <commit_hash>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   reportgen 8d403a9
   ```

   This will:

   - Generate a summary of changes introduced by that specific commit.
   - Provide a concise set of topics reflecting what changed in that commit.

   Example Output

   - Added new type definitions for Tutor entity in Tutors component
   - Refactored TutorItem props for improved type safety
   - Updated TutorsList component to handle missing index
